### Important:

It is better to have Python version 3.9.0 or greater to be installed to create this application. 

Before running the application, you must run the following commands to install relevant libraries and versions:

#### !pip install streamlit
#### !pip install google-generativeai
#### !pip install python-dotenv
#### !pip install protobuf==3.20.*





Note: If you don't provide anything as text in the input, the 'Generate' button will give the basic description of the image.
However, upon providing input text e.g. "Based on the image, generate a blog", the application will generate a cool blog for you!
